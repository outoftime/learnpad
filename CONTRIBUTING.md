# :+1::tada: Welcome Popcode Contributor! :tada::+1:

Looking to get involved? There are a [ton of
ways](https://github.com/popcodeorg/popcode/issues)
Popcode could be made better. Pull requests, bug reports, feature suggestions
are all very very welcome.

When you’re first getting started, I recommend picking a [good first issue
](https://github.com/popcodeorg/popcode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) so you can get your feet wet and make sure you can run a development environment smoothly.

Everyone is welcome to submit pull requests that implement a new feature or fix
a bug that you’re particularly passionate about. But if you just want to help
out and you’re looking for ideas, I recommend checking out the [help wanted
label](https://github.com/popcodeorg/popcode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
